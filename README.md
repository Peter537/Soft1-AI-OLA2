## Deliverables

1. The Jupyter Notebook containing a supervised learning project is located in [supervised_learning.ipynb](./supervised_learning.ipynb)
2. A short presentation of measuring distance between datapoints are made in both:
   - PDF in [measuring_distance_presentation.pdf](./measuring_distance_presentation.pdf)
   - Markdown in [measuring_distance_presentation.md](./measuring_distance_presentation.md)
3. An application of our Jupyter Notebook has been made in the form of a web application using Streamlit. The application is located in [streamlit_app.py](./streamlit_app.py)
