## Business Case

We want to make an AI that can distinguish between positive and negative movie reviews. This AI will be used by a movie review website to automatically categorize reviews as positive or negative.

Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews

## Deliverables

1. The Jupyter Notebook containing a supervised learning project is located in [supervised_learning.ipynb](./supervised_learning.ipynb)
2. A short presentation of measuring distance between datapoints are made in both:
   - PDF in [measuring_distance_presentation.pdf](./measuring_distance_presentation.pdf)
   - Markdown in [measuring_distance_presentation.md](./measuring_distance_presentation.md)
3. The Streamlit application is:
   - Documented in [streamlit.md](./streamlit.md)
   - Programmed in [streamlit_app.py](./streamlit_app.py)
